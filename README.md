# Similar Vulnerable Code Identification
----
### What i am doing?
  There are some identical signatures between vulnerable Web Application implement, i am tring to summary the signatures and making the same type of vulnerable code into a set.

### Why do this?
  I want to adopt an easiest automated approach to identify that type of the vulnerable Web Application when i do code analysis.

### Why Yara?
  The first reaction to reach the goal is to invent a complex algorithm, but that's too "expensive", and who knows what the outcome will be? So why not try an existing technique,
  Yara was invented to identify binary malwares, but its powerful capabilities of RegEx and string analysis also can be applied to identify the signatures of Web applications.
